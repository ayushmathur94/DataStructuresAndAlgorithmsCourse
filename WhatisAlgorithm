What is an Algorithm ?

An algorithm describes the steps you have to perform to accomplish a specific task.

For Example -
Algo for making tea -
1. Boil water
2. Add a teabag to a cup
3. Pour the boiling water into the cup
4. Remove the teabag when tea is ready
5. Add the desired amount of milk to the cup
6. Add the desired amount of sugar to the cup
7. Stir the contents of the cup with a spoon

** There can be many algorithms that accomplish the same task

Algorithm and Implementation
** An algorithm is not an implementation 

An algorithm describes steps you have to perform.

Implementation is the code you write to perform those steps. There can be many implementations of the same algorithm.
